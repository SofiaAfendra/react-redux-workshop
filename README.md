# Agile Actors Academy

React Workshop!

## Branch Description

In this branch, we will introduce the concept of state. Our goal is to add state to the **Square** component.

## What is state?

State is a built-in React object that allows components to keep track of changing information. It is a way to store data that can change over time. When the state of a component changes, the component will re-render.

For example, in our tic-tac-toe game, we want to keep track of which squares have been clicked and what the current value of the square is. We can use state to store this information.

**Branch Task:**

1. Add logic to the Square component so when it's clicked it updates it's state and draws an 'X' or an 'O'.

**Covers:**

- React core concepts
