## Branch Description

In this branch, we will introduce the concept of handling user input.

User input is any information that a user provides to a software program. This can be done through a variety of ways, such as typing into a text box, selecting items in a list, or clicking a button.

## Branch Tasks

1. Utilize the _Game_ component provided and modify each input, so that the values provided by the users are stored in state.

   > Hint: The state for each input should update whenever the input value changes.

2. Create a status value depending on which player is next and render it in the specified div.
3. Create a button that clears/resets the _Game_ component's state when clicked. Squares, inputs and status should return to initial values.
