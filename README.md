## Branch Description

In this branch, you will be introduced to the concept handling user input.

**Branch Task:**

1. Utilize the **Game** component provided and modify each input, so that the values provided by the users are stored in state.
hint: The state for each input should update whenever the input value changes. 
2. Create a status value depending on which player is next and render it in the specified div.
3. Create a button that clears/resets the **Game** component's state when clicked. Squares, inputs and status should return to initial values.
