## Branch description

In this branch we will make all business logic, that now resides in the **Game** component, reusable by creating a **withGameProps** Higher Order Component (HOC). Accordingly, we will follow these steps for the **Board** component.

## Branch Tasks

1. Create a Higher Order Component (HOC) withGameProps.
2. Move the **Game** component useEffect, useState, useRef hooks and the rest functionality to the HOC.
3. Create a HOC withBoardProps.
4. Move the **Board** component functionality to the HOC.
