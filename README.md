# Agile Actors Academy

React Workshop

**Branch Tasks:**

1. Inside `actions.js` define and export all tic-tac-toe related actions, they should return action objects with the type and payload properties.

2. Inside _store/store.js_
   replace initialTestState and testReducer with initialGameState and gameReduxReducer from
   `models/gameRedux/reducer.js`.
   > NOTE: _The reducer at `game/reducer.js` return an Object with property type and optionally a property payload so we can reuse it at our Redux store._

- Open Redux Dev Tools and try dispatching an action.
