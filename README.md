## Branch Description

In this branch, you will be introduced to the concept of lifting state up. Your goal is to move the state for the **Square** component inside the new **Board** component.

**Branch Task:**

1. Find a way to lift the state so that the **Board** has all the state for each **Sqaure** component.
2. Utilize the renderSquare to return a **Square** component with a value and an onClick as props.
3. Utilize renderRow to return three **Square** components inside the **Board** component.
4. Make sure that if a square has a value it no longer changes when clicked.
