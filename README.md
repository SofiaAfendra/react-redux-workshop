# Agile Actors Academy

Welcome to React Workshop!

## Introduction

In this workshop we introduce the core concepts of React and how we can use them to develop a modern web application.

We will go from the fundamentals of React to building a whole application using React, Redux and RxJS.

## What We Will Build

We are going to build a multi player tic tac toe game using React.

We have split the steps in several branches. Each branch has its own tasks which you have to complete in order to proceed to the next branch.

## Getting Started

Open a terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://replace-with-correct-repo
```

_If you do not have git install follow this link [How to install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install it_

Navigate into the root directory and install application dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd aa-react-training
```

```bash
npm i
```

Run the application using the command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Branch Description

This is the starting branch. Preview the application files and open **src/main.jsx** to start your first task.

**Branch Tasks:**

1. Create a simple React Component
2. Render the Component into the DOM

**Covers:**

- React core concepts
- React Component creation
